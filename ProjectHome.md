# TitanFiesta #

This is a project to create an **Open Source** server emulator for the _Fiesta Online_ game.

You can find the Titan Fiesta Wiki @ http://fiesta.thedgtl.net
The wiki will contain all of the information we have on the game, including packets, encryption, instructions, etc.

We are currently not looking for any devs, since the server is in it's infancy having more people work on it would lead to confusion. Once we get a more stable base, we will post about looking for more devs :)

If you do download the code to try, please keep in mind that it **is** a dev release, and there **are** problems. If you notice a feature missing, it's probably because we haven't coded it yet, if you notice a bug in a feature that is already coded, then it would be nice to hear about it.

See the wiki for how to use the project.

And don't post questions like "Why does it say missing mysql.h?" This is a DEV RELEASE, don't be an idiot, if you can't code, don't try to run it.

Please do not post bugs asking why the server won't compile for you. I know for a fact that everything on SVN compiles, and if it doesn't, I'll fix it eventually, since I can't do any work unless it compiles. If you encounter a valid bug, then feel free to submit it to the Issues tracker.
